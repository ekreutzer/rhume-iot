#THIS CODE IS MEANT FOR THE DEVICE TO BE PLACED
#INSIDE OF THE ROOM WHERE PEOPLE NEED TO BE COUNTED

#Created by Shawn Kotch for Rhume

#Sensor Attachments to RPi 3
    #Far sensor (Farther from the door inside the room)
        #Black: Pin 16 - GPIO 23
        #Blue: Pin 6 - GND
        #Brown: Pin 2 - 5V
    #Close Sensor (Closer to the door inside the room)
        #Black: Pin 40 - GPIO 21
        #Blue: Pin 32 - GND
        #Brown: Pin 4 - 5V
